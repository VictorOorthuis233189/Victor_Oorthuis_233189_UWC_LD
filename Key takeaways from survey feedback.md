Key takeaways from survey feedback (response 3):

feedback in the feedback section of the survey (feedback bold, response as bullet point):


**During the manual annotation process, it became apparent that the current landmark order for correction is not the most intuitive or logical.**

* We could ofcourse change the order, but I do not know what would be more intuitive or logical, maybe we can ask the client?

**Once the image is uploaded, display the file name.**

* This should be an easy addition.

**Allow for contrast adjustment.** 

* Tricky to add, but probably valuable. We should look into it

**Consider adding landmark definitions.**

* Unsure what is meant by definitions. If it means the full names of landmarks, like "Sella" which is currently noted as "S", we can probably make options to use full titles instead of the letters. Shouldn't be difficult to implement.

**It would also be valuable to first perform manual landmark placement and only thereafter review the predicted placements, to ensure that the manual annotations are not influenced or biased by the automated output.**

* This is currently already possible. However, since the user has noted this, it might not be as intuitive. It doesn't help that the image has to be uploaded on the predictions tab. Should the manual detection maybe be moved before the predictions tab? I've experimented with this before, and changing where the image is uploaded in the current state of the app is quite tricky. I'd recommend waiting for more feedback. If it's consistently found to be unintuitive, try to make the change.

**The ways of zooming in and out of the images could be a bit confusing because on some sections theres a clear icon for it but on others you have to do it manually on the mouse pad.** 

* Good point, zooming should be intuitive and easy as assessing annotation quality relies heavily on this. Even if it's a slightly more difficult thing to do, this is an important thing to do.

* After checking the app again, we have this, but only on our dev version. We'll need to update the app on GCP.

**For selectivting measurment options to add to the notes, it should be a bit more clear that you have selected one or multiple measurments before clickin the option of adding to notes.** 

* Jason

**When you add notes you can only view them on the specific section where you added it, maybe there should be a way of seeing all the notes in one section or when you click the ""add notes"" you could see all the notes through out the analysis instead of the notes per section.**

* Jason

**A drawing option could be implemented as an extra; adding lines, being able to measure angles between landmarks and free-handed drawing.** 

* While valuable, this is out of scope. With only 2 weeks to go this is unfortunately not feasible.
